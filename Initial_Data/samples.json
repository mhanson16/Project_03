    "Emission Type":["Cement", "Coal", "Flaring","Gas","Oil"],
    "metadata":[{"Emission Type": "Cement", "Definition": "Carbon dioxide is emitted as a by-product of clinker production, an intermediate product in cement manufacture, in which calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is calcinated and converted to lime (CaO), the primary component of cement.",
     "Contributing Factors": "Construction (mainly Nonresidential construction and government construction projects)"},
     {"Emission Type": "Coal", "Definition": "When coal is burned, the carbon in the coal combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. Coal is not 100 percent carbon: burning a pound of coal emits 2.07 pounds of CO2.",
     "Contributing Factors": "Electricy Production"}, 
     {"Emission Type": "Flaring", "Definition": "the process of burning excess natural gas at the production well using a dedicated flare to ignite the methane and other components in the gas, which can result in both methane and carbon dioxide emissions (CO2).",
      "Contributing Factors": "Oil extraction and processing"},
    {"Emission Type": "Gas", "Definition":"Every gallon of gasoline burned creates about 8,887 grams of CO2.",
    "Contributing Factors":"Chemicals & petrochemicals: ammonia, which is used for purifying water supplies, cleaning products, and as a refrigerant, and used in the production of many materials, including plastic, fertilizers, pesticides, and textiles."},
    {"Emission Type": "Oil", "Definition": "Oil refining processes are energy-intensive, requiring considerable amounts of direct or indirect heat. Between 7% and 15% of the crude oil input is used by the refinery processes.",
    "Contributing Factors": "Transportation (road, aviation, pipeline), Chemical & petrochemical (manufacturing of fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, refrigerants), Gas and Diesel are main products"}]
