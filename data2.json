        {"Overview": "When coal is burned, the carbon in the coal combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. Coal is not 100 percent carbon: burning a pound of coal emits 2.07 pounds of CO2.",

    "Oil": {
        "Overview": "Oil refining processes are energy-intensive, requiring considerable amounts of direct or indirect heat. Between 7% and 15% of the crude oil input is used by the refinery processes.",
